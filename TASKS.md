### ðŸŽ‰ BUILD SUCCESSFUL! Ready for Testing!

## Current Tasks ðŸš§

### Testing Phase
- [ ] Run updated build-and-deploy.bat to compile and deploy
- [ ] Check logs for server startup confirmation
- [ ] Test basic health endpoint: GET http://localhost:7891/api/health
- [ ] Test Revit version endpoint: GET http://localhost:7891/api/revit/version
- [ ] Test element endpoints:
  - [ ] GET http://localhost:7891/api/element/category/{categoryName}
  - [ ] GET http://localhost:7891/api/element/type/{typeName}
- [ ] Test MCP endpoint: POST http://localhost:7891/api/element/mcp

## Future Tasks ðŸ“‹

### Code Cleanup
- [ ] Fix async method warnings (add proper async/await)
- [ ] Update deprecated Revit API usage (ElementId constructors and properties)

### Once Core is Stable
- [ ] Re-enable DynamoController
- [ ] Re-enable ScanToBIMController
- [ ] Re-enable UndergroundUtilitiesController
- [ ] Add proper error handling
- [ ] Implement logging throughout
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Create integration tests
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Create user guide

### MCP Features
- [ ] Implement full MCP protocol compliance
- [ ] Add schema validation
- [ ] Create more tool endpoints
- [ ] Add authentication/authorization
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add request/response logging

## Notes
- Build output is in `bin\Release\` (not `bin\Release\net48\`)
- Keep changes minimal - one feature at a time
- Test thoroughly before adding complexity
- Document changes in PROJECT_STATUS.md
- Use Sequential Thinking MCP toolkit for complex problems
- EmbedIO routing: base path in WithWebApi(), relative paths in Route attributes
- Revit API requires ApplicationInitialized event for full Application access
- Use fully qualified names when namespace conflicts occur
- Web server runs asynchronously without blocking Revit's thread
