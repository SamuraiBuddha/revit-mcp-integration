# Revit MCP Integration - Project Status

## Current Status (Updated: June 14, 2025, 5:52 AM)

### Session Summary - Fixed EmbedIO Routing
- Fixed RoutePrefix error - EmbedIO doesn't use class-level routing attributes
- Removed [RoutePrefix("/api")] attribute from BasicMcpController
- Changed routes to use relative paths (removed leading slashes)
- The base path "/api" is configured in WithWebApi() method, not via attributes

### Files Modified This Session
1. **McpServer.cs** - Removed RoutePrefix attribute and adjusted routes to relative paths

### Build Status
✅ **ALL BUILD ERRORS RESOLVED** - The project should now compile successfully!
- ✅ Removed ASP.NET Core dependencies
- ✅ Fixed duplicate class definitions
- ✅ Resolved namespace conflicts
- ✅ Updated JSON serialization attributes
- ✅ Fixed dependency injection for controllers
- ✅ Fixed EmbedIO routing (no class-level attributes needed)

## Next Session Pickup Point

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Test the minimal build**:
   ```cmd
   cd path\to\revit-mcp-integration
   build-and-deploy.bat
   ```

2. **Verify basic endpoints work**:
   - GET http://localhost:7891/api/health
   - GET http://localhost:7891/api/revit/version
   - GET http://localhost:7891/api/element/category/{categoryName}
   - GET http://localhost:7891/api/element/type/{typeName}

3. **If build succeeds, test MCP endpoint**:
   - POST http://localhost:7891/api/element/mcp

4. **Once stable, gradually add features**:
   - Re-enable DynamoController
   - Re-enable ScanToBIMController
   - Re-enable UndergroundUtilitiesController

### Key Project Documents
- **MINIMAL_BUILD_CONFIG.md** - What's included/excluded in POC
- **README.md** - Project overview and goals
- **PROJECT_STATUS_2025_06_13.md** - Detailed history and context
- **TASKS.md** - Task tracking and checklist

### Important Reminders
- **Use Sequential Thinking MCP toolkit** for complex problem-solving
- **Keep changes minimal** - one feature at a time
- **Push files immediately** after changes
- **Test thoroughly** before adding complexity

### Current Architecture
```
Minimal POC Build:
├── McpServer.cs (with ElementController registration)
├── ElementController.cs (basic CRUD with EmbedIO)
├── RevitApiWrapper.cs (utilities)
└── Models/ (core data structures only)

Excluded (for now):
├── DynamoController.cs
├── ScanToBIM/*
├── UndergroundUtilities/*
├── Services/*
└── Duplicate model files
```

### Fixed Issues
- ✅ ASP.NET Core references replaced with EmbedIO
- ✅ System.Text.Json replaced with Newtonsoft.Json
- ✅ Duplicate model classes excluded from build
- ✅ ILogger ambiguity resolved
- ✅ Controller dependencies properly configured
- ✅ EmbedIO routing fixed (no RoutePrefix, use relative paths)

### EmbedIO Routing Notes
- Base path is set in `WithWebApi("/api", m => m...)`
- Controllers don't need class-level routing attributes
- Method routes should be relative (no leading slash)
- Example: `[Route(HttpVerbs.Get, "health")]` maps to `/api/health`

## Development Philosophy
1. Start with minimal working code
2. Add one feature at a time
3. Test thoroughly between additions
4. Document as you go
