# Revit MCP Integration - Project Status

## Current Status (Updated: June 14, 2025, 5:06 AM)

### Session Summary
- Created minimal POC configuration
- Excluded complex components from build (ScanToBIM, UndergroundUtilities, Dynamo)
- Updated project file with exclusions
- Updated McpServer.cs to register ElementController

### Files Modified This Session
1. **RevitMcpServer.csproj** - Added exclusions for complex components
2. **McpServer.cs** - Added ElementController registration
3. **MINIMAL_BUILD_CONFIG.md** - Created build configuration guide

### Ready to Build
The project is now configured for a minimal proof-of-concept build. Next step is to run `build-and-deploy.bat` and test.

## Next Session Pickup Point

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Test the minimal build**:
   ```cmd
   cd path\to\revit-mcp-integration
   build-and-deploy.bat
   ```

2. **Verify basic endpoints work**:
   - GET http://localhost:7891/api/health
   - GET http://localhost:7891/api/revit/version
   - GET http://localhost:7891/api/elements

3. **Fix any compilation errors in ElementController.cs**

4. **Once stable, add features one at a time**

### Key Project Documents
- **MINIMAL_BUILD_CONFIG.md** - What's included/excluded in POC
- **README.md** - Project overview and goals
- **PROJECT_STATUS_2025_06_13.md** - Detailed history and context

### Important Reminders
- **Use Sequential Thinking MCP toolkit** for complex problem-solving
- **Keep changes minimal** - one feature at a time
- **Push files immediately** after changes
- **Test thoroughly** before adding complexity

### Current Architecture
```
Minimal POC Build:
├── McpServer.cs (with ElementController)
├── ElementController.cs (basic CRUD)
├── RevitApiWrapper.cs (utilities)
└── Models/ (data structures)

Excluded (for now):
├── DynamoController.cs
├── ScanToBIM/*
├── UndergroundUtilities/*
└── Services/*
```

### Build Errors Expected
ElementController.cs may have some compilation errors that need fixing. These should be simple to resolve.

## Development Philosophy
1. Start with minimal working code
2. Add one feature at a time
3. Test thoroughly between additions
4. Document as you go
